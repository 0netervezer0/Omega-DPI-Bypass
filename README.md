## Problems that may arise during installation
#### False positive antivirus
Since Lupi DPI Bypass is rarely downloaded, it may not be listed in many antivirus databases as safe. Also, the antivirus may be triggered because the program is interpreted, not compiled.

The developer guarantees the safety of installation and use of the program. If you do not trust the file builded by the developer, you can build the program yourself. All source files are provided in the repository.
